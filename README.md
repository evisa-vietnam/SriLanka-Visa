How to Apply for an ETA:
1.	Visit the Sri Lanka ETA Website: You can apply for your visa online via the official Sri Lanka ETA portal [ https://www.govt.sl/en-us/ ].
2.	Provide Personal Information: You’ll need to provide basic personal details, travel information, and your passport details.
3.	Payment: The ETA application requires a processing fee, which can be paid through the online portal.
4.	Processing Time: The ETA is usually processed within a few days, but it's recommended to apply at least 72 hours before your departure.
Once approved, the ETA allows you to stay in Sri Lanka for up to 30 days. It can be extended for an additional 6 months if needed. Citizens of most countries are eligible to apply for an ETA, but it’s always a good idea to double-check the current visa policies for your country.
